# Email Administration Application

Hello,

This application has been designed using Object-Oriented-Programming fundamentals. It is a great demonstration of application architecture in Java.
This app generates company email accounts for new hires in different company departments. An interactive console helps you add information as needed,
which is stored and displayed later. Random passwords are generated for the accounts. These can be changed if the user wishes to do so.

Thank you!
